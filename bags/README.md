# Metal Detector bags

Bag files for testing the metal detector.

## Files

* forward_backward_mine.bag

Contains all the robot's topics while passing through an area with a mine. The robot moves forward for an arbitrary period, passing on top of the mine, and then backwards to its initial position.

* forward_backward_no_mine.bag

Contains all the robot's topics while passing through the same area as the other bag, only now without the mine.
